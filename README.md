# angular-webpack-starter
Starter for frontend app with webpack, angular, karma, jasmine

This configuration supports multiple projects which may have common parts, for example customer styles or controls.

npm run start-* is like ng serve -> it starts project in development mode with hot deploy

npm run build-* builds project for higher development environments, and outputs them into dist. From there they need to be simply copied into, for example spring app target folder

npm run test runs unit tests in *.spec.ts files

This project needs some polishing, but otherwise it is complete starter for small and big projects alike
